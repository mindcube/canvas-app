## Edge Cases

- Images should not be draggable into a position where they are partially outside of the canvas

## Submission Questions

- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?

I took some time on this solution as I was not as familiar with using the HTML5 canvas api, and wanted to learn
more about it so I actually spent a little more time than necessary. Overall, I would say I sepnt anywhere from 6-8 hours on this.

- What about this assignment did you find most challenging?

I think the most challenging part for me was figuring out how to leverage React features for redrawing the canvas. As well, I did spent some time trying to figure out how to make dragging/redrawing more performant (especially when it came to flickering effects berween draws).

- What about this assignment did you find unclear?

There wasn't much to question about this assignment, especially with the great initial documentation and instructions provided.

- What challenges did you face that you did not expect?

1.  Screen flickering betwen canvas drawing - had to go back to the drawing board a couple of times to think through
    how/why flickering would happen.
2.  zIndex. I'm new to using HTML Canvas elements so my initial thought was to use css styles to position the image elements on "top". This proves not to be the case, though since images are drawn. This is something I need to do more research on, but definitely possible with a little more time.
3.  Figuring out how to detect and trgger the dragging mouse movement to stay 'inside' the canvas boundry took some extra elbow grease, but managed to figure it out.

- Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?

Definitely - it was a fun challenge for me and it required some research + trial and error. I now know a lot more about HTML5 Canvas API and how it works.
